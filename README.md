## Professional Self-Assessment
During my time at SNHU in the Computer Science program, I’ve been constantly challenged with new software and projects that have stretched my skills. From the beginning courses which introduced me to my first Python code to now working with full-stack, cloud-native solutions, I have grown so much in my understanding and skillset. As someone who would ultimately like to work in full-stack engineering or software development, I’ve focused my current projects and research on creating clean code and integrating databases into a way that is easily scaled.

My ePortfolio focuses on a Java-based application that tracks, sorts, and updates service animals that I have worked to develop and enhance throughout this term in three core areas: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. The enhancements have improved the application and demonstrated my abilities in real-world applications. 

Beyond my artifact, I have also gained additional experience in full-stack web development through my full-stack development I and II courses in which I developed various applications using Java and AWS using serverless architecture. This gave me hands-on experience with my area of interest and solidified my desire to purchase this field as I saw how it operated in production environments.

## Collaborating in a Team Environment and Communication with Stakeholders
The majority of my courses through my time in the program have emphasized collaboration with fellow developments and communication with a team or peer, which was helpful to my growth as a team member. These classes along with my internship gave me valuable experience in operating as a team, share code, and give and receive constructive feedback.

For my capstone code review, I had to present my plan in a professional and approachable way as if I was speaking with a project manager. This experience, which I’ve also done in my internship, showed me how important clear communication is and not to rush the explanations. This is a skill I will continue to rely on in the future.

## CSoftware Engineering and Full-Stack Development
My enhancement for software design focused on organizing my code and error handling. I refactored my code into reusable elements for both the dog and monkey components and added in helper methods to support the overall application that was easier to read and maintain. The input validation and error handling was handled for all inputs, and this is something that I improved on and adjusted at the next stage of enhancements.

This is also something I focused on in my full stack development course, where I containerized a web application using Docker and deploying it through AWS. Docker Compose was also used to hold multiple containers (frontend, backend API, and MongoDB database) which was moved to Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB for improved scaling of a cloud-based solution. This project taught me how to utilize RESTful APIs and scale applications in a cost-saving way. Both experiences showed my ability to design and maintain code that is easy to maintain and organized regardless of their size.

## Data Structures and Algorithms
For Enhancement Two, I dove into algorithm design and how to apply structures to solve real-world problems for rescue animal adoption. In this project, I created a matching and scoring system which paired adopters with a rescue animal by using a weighted score that then dynamically sorted the top five matches. The algorithm also scored energy-level based on the animal’s weight in order to create the best match. This taught me how to balance complex algorithms with functional code that is easy to maintain, which improves user experience.

## Database Management and Security
In Enhancement Three, I reworked my code once again to utilize a SQLite database rather than in-memory storage using JDBC. The schema had to be designed to account for various attributes some of which had crossover for both animals and some that did not. I had to handle all SQL insertions with prepared statements that would be protected against any injection attacks.

In full stack development, I built on these skills by utilizing MongoDB and DynamoDB, both of which are NoSQL databases, but use different structures. Using Lambda functions, the backend logic had to be created to interface directly with DynamoDB for easy user access. The IAM roles also had to be added to control access to the system using role-based policies. For additional security, API Gateway tokens were used to further protect it from attack. These experiences reflect my technical skills with integration of databases as well as my ability to emphasize and build security into an application from the beginning. 

## In Conclusion
The three enhancements were all based on the same Java-based rescue animal application, which helped to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the code and its needed improvements. I was able to take a basic application and improve the user experience so they can track, store, and update rescue animals in a way that is easy to maintain and can be scaled up should new animals need to be added. 
The enhancements demonstrate my skills in:
-Object-oriented programming
-Real-world use of algorithms and data filtering
-Database integration and validation logic
-Security-based coding and defensive programming

## Looking Ahead
This project and program have given me the knowledge and technical foundation to build on in the future in my role as a software developer or full stack developer. I’ve learned how to approach projects in a methodical way by taking it one step at a time, building scalable projects, and prioritizing functionality and user experience. My ePortfolio reflects both my technical growth and my ability to adapt to new tools and technologies. I now have a basic understanding of backend systems, APIs, and refactoring existing code, and can bring a thoughtful approach to improving projects in the future.
